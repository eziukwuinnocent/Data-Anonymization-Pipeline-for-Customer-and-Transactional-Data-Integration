This project focused on building a robust data anonymization pipeline to enable CBA and InsightSpark to combine customer data from the CBA mobile app with supermarket transactional data.

To facilitate a data science initiative for CBA and InsightSpark, I developed a privacy pipeline with Microsoft Excel, to anonymize sensitive customer data from the CBA mobile app before its integration with supermarket transactional data. This project addressed the critical need for data privacy, focusing on preventing linkage attacks and ensuring compliance. By implementing robust anonymization techniques, I enabled secure data sharing while preserving the data's utility for analytical purposes.

Key aspects of the project included:

1. Analysis of potential privacy risks and implementation of appropriate anonymization techniques within Microsoft Excel.
2. Development of a scalable pipeline to process and anonymize large datasets, with initial stages executed in Excel.3
3. Ensuring the anonymized data maintained its analytical utility for data science initiatives.
4. Thorough testing and validation to guarantee the effectiveness of the anonymization process.
5. Research and application of best practices regarding linkage attacks prevention.
